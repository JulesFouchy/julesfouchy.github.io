<!-- ## Lille VJ Fest (2025 May 15-17)

Anecdote : j'ai pas candidaté assez tôt, ils ont fermé les inscriptions. Puis j'ai envoyé un mail pour forcer et j'ai quand même pû y aller grâce à des désistetements.
Morale / Note to myself: 
- Pas remettre les choses au lendemain
- Faut avoir du culot parfois et tenter / forcer -->

## 👩‍🏫 Summer Internships (2025 May 05 - August 01)

<!-- TODO take a picture with them at Lille VJ Fest -->

## 📽 Animeet Lyon (Color Space) (2025 April 26-27)

[Animeet](https://linktr.ee/animeet.fr)<br/>
We made a short animation movie in two days. I did the sky in [Coollab](https://coollab-art.com/), the planets, the movement of the ship and the color change animation in Godot.

## 🎮 Game Jam des étoiles (POV Meteor) (2025 April 04-06)

We made a game that was played on a huge dome at the planetarium of [La Cité des Sciences](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/accueil). The biggest challenge was to find a way for all the public to play at the same time. We made a voting system from your phone, were everybody could vote on where the asteroid would go.

## 👩‍🏫 ENJMIN Game Conference (2025 February 26-28)

I did a 1 hour talk about shader art for the [ENJMIN Game Conference](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin-game-conferences/enjmin-game-conferences-1111200.kjsp) in Angoulême<br/>

Giving a talk is so nice because afterwards people just come to talk to you about your talk, i.e. subjects you love. I met a ton a very nice people (and promoted Coollab 😇)

[Some resources](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Faire-de-l-art-avec-des-maths), and my slides (press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to go to the next slide):<br/>

## 🥳 Coollab 1.0 Release (2025 February 25)

I finally released the 1.0 version of [Coollab](https://coollab-art.com/)! After 4.5 years of development, with the release of the Launcher I think the software is finally stable enough to go out of the beta phase. (And also I'm starting to have a few users, so I can't break everything all the time anymore 🙄)

## 🎮 Game Jam DS (Platformeuche) (2025 February 14-16)

A platformer almost entirely in the dark (because we didn't want to have to find assets to decorate the level 😇)

<!-- ## 😴 Started a regular sleep schedule (2025 February 13)

As of writing this (3 months later) I'm still holding on to it and I really like it. I am now a morning person, working intensely from 8a.m. to 2p.m., then taking a nap, and then chilling for the rest of the day.

## 📽 48-Hour Short Film Challenge (Histoires de Sorcières) (2025 January 17-19)

I did the credit sequence (with [Coollab](https://coollab-art.com/)) in this short movie made by two friends (MeucheRoume and Talia'Kah)

## 🥳 Word It! release (2025 January 02)

After 7 months of development, we released our first mobile game!

With MeucheRoume we wanted to try make a small mobile game and see if we could make some money off of it. We didn't, but it was fun doing my first project with Godot! I really really love this engine, definitely the best for 2D games.

[Download it on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meuchecorp.wordit)

## 👩‍🏫 Coollab workshop for middle school students in Bordeaux (Collège Georges Lapierre) (2024 November 06)

I was invited by a friend who works there (Océane). It was nice to work with young people (13-14 years old), they really enjoyed the images we could make easily with Coollab and all the fun effects.

## 👩‍🏫 Volunteer at OggCamp (2024 October 12-13)

I went to this open-source conference, and decided to volunteer so I would more easily meet some people. I ended up helping speakers setup their computer in the main room, and asking for questions at the end and handing out the microphone

## 🎊 Festijam (2024 September 14)

The Festijam is a small independent festival, entirely run by volunteers. I was contacted by Rémi to do a video installation where the public could change some parameters from a small touch screen on the side and see the result live on the screen behind the musicians.

## 👩‍🏫 Libre Graphics Meeting, Rennes (2024 May 09-12)

A very nice conference for open-source software related to graphics. I presented Coollab during a lightning talk, and met developers of Gimp and Inkscape. Thank you Gimp Foundation for inviting us to the restaurant!

## 👩‍🏫 Journée d'étude sur le live coding (2024 April 23)

Just went there to see some talks. It was more music-oriented which is not really what I am into, but this is where I discovered the existence of the Libre Graphics Meeting, thanks to a small link at the bottom of a huge presentation slide by Raphaël Bastide. Moral: always go and see stuff, you might be surprised.

## 👩‍🏫 Creative Code Berlin (2023 July 05-17)

I went to Berlin to join the Stammtisch, where I presented Coollab and met some very nice people. They told me about a vvvv meetup so I went there. I discovered vvvv which is a very nice software, met some nice people again. They told me about the TouchDesigner meetup so I went there. I really love Berlin, there are so many creative-coding events! Also the city is very nice, full of gardens and greenery! I really enjoyed wandering around the streets there.

I also went to the Jam and implemented a nice effect that someone showed during the Stammtisch (slit-scan).
