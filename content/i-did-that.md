<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/peckham.jpg"/>
<i style={{fontSize: "12px"}}>Workshop at Peckham Digital, Photo ¬© Mati Granica</i>

This was my first proper Coollab workshop! And I was invited to give it, the festival found me and wanted a Coollab workshop! That's so cool, Coollab is starting to be known a bit!

### Festijam

Interactive installation for this small independent festival.

Talia'Kah did the art and I did the technical support ^^

### Co-founding Visuell

*2025 May 25 - August 17*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/visuell.png"/>

https://www.visuell.art/

They posted on Creative Code Berlin's discord that they were looking for a Tech Lead. Their product idea looks cool, and they are very nice, and I have been wanting to join a startup for a long time! For once I will be the one making the decisions from the start of the project, I can make sure we have a solid architecture.
Also, they are good at marketing, and I'm glad to have other people that I can rely on for that.

EDIT: I ended up not staying in the project for too long, because I already have so many other things to do and wanted to save some time for myself. Also I started enjoying my job at Smode a lot, which removed the need for me to find my next job.

<!-- ### Summer Internships (2025 May 05 - August 01)

I took three interns this summer:

**Anna-Maria** (Website Overhaul)<br/>

### Libre Graphics Meeting

*Nurnberg, 2025 May 28-31*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/LGM%20Nurnberg.jpg"/>

LGM 2025 was amazing! Just like last year I met so many interesting people, saw some familiar faces and also met new people. We had so many nice discussions about many topics, mostly around software (which are my favorite discussions). I might have found someone interested to do some UX on Coollab, and did a lightning talk again to showcase Coollab! Had a few feedback from a few people telling me it looked very good, which made me happy üòÅ

https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2025/

My talk starts at 21:30

### Lille VJ Fest

*Lille, 2025 May 15-17*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/vjfest2025.jpg" style={{ height: '700px', width: 'auto' }}/>

Did a 20 minute VJ show with Talia'Kah, using Coollab. Was nice, I'm happy of what we did, and I also learned so many things that I need to improve in the software. Very nice people as usual, and they told me I should organize a Coollab workshop next time, so I sure will!

### Animeet Lyon

*Lyon, 2025 April 26-27*

<YoutubeVideo url = "b00Np7oSVOY"/>

[Animeet](https://linktr.ee/animeet.fr)<br/>
We made a short animation movie in two days. I did the sky in [Coollab](https://coollab-art.com/), the planets, the movement of the ship and the color change animation in Godot.

With Poulpillow and Talia'Kah.

### Game Jam des √©toiles

*Paris, 2025 April 04-06*

<YoutubeVideo url = "Vkpi0ViUFbU?start=200"/>
<br/>

We made a game that was played on a huge dome at the planetarium of [La Cit√© des Sciences](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/accueil). The biggest challenge was to find a way for all the audience to play at the same time. Me made it so you can vote from a website on your phone, and decide where the asteroid would go.

### ENJMIN Game Conference

<IFrame url="https://julesfouchy.github.io/Faire-de-l-art-avec-des-maths/"/>

*Press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to go to the next slide*

I did a 1 hour talk about shader art for the [ENJMIN Game Conference](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin-game-conferences/enjmin-game-conferences-1111200.kjsp), and then a workshop on the same topic.

Giving a talk is so nice because afterwards people just come to talk to you about your talk, i.e. subjects you love. I met a ton a very nice people (and promoted Coollab üòá)

### Coollab 1.0 Release

*2025 February 25*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/Coollab%20V1.png"/>

I finally released the 1.0 version of [Coollab](https://coollab-art.com/)! After 4.5 years of development, with the release of the Launcher I think the software is finally stable enough to go out of the beta phase. (And also I'm starting to have a few users, so I can't break everything all the time anymore üôÑ)

### Game Jam DS

*Champs-sur-Marne, 2025 February 14-16*

<YoutubeVideo url = "sS-Hwup0DFA"/>
<br/>

A platformer staged almost entirely in the dark (because we didn't want to have to find assets to decorate the level üòá)

[Download the game](https://meucheroume.itch.io/platformeuche)

With MeucheRoume.

<!-- ### üò¥ Started a regular sleep schedule (2025 February 13)

As of writing this (3 months later) I'm still holding on to it and I really like it. I am now a morning person, working intensely from 8a.m. to 2p.m., then taking a nap, and then chilling for the rest of the day.

### Release of "Word It!"

*2025 January 02*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/wordit.gif" style={{ height: '700px', width: 'auto' }} />/>

After 7 months of development, we released our first mobile game!

With MeucheRoume we wanted to try make a small mobile game and see if we could make some money off of it. We didn't, but it was fun doing my first project with Godot! I really really love this engine, definitely the best for 2D games.

[Download it on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meuchecorp.wordit)

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/LGM%20Rennes.png"/>

A very nice conference for open-source software related to graphics. I presented Coollab during a lightning talk, and met developers of Gimp and Inkscape. Thank you Gimp Foundation for inviting us to the restaurant!

<!-- ### Journ√©e d'√©tude sur le live coding (2024 April 23)

Just went there to see some talks. It was more music-oriented which is not really what I am into, but this is where I discovered the existence of the Libre Graphics Meeting, thanks to a small link at the bottom of a huge presentation slide by Rapha√´l Bastide. Moral: always go and see stuff, you might be surprised.

### Creative Code Berlin

*Berlin, 2023 July 05-17*

<ImageZoom src="/img/i_did_that/creative_code_berlin.avif"/>

I went to Berlin to join the Stammtisch, where I presented Coollab and met some very nice people. They told me about a vvvv meetup so I went there. I discovered vvvv which is a very nice software, met some nice people again. They told me about the TouchDesigner meetup so I went there. I really love Berlin, there are so many creative-coding events! Also the city is very nice, full of gardens and greenery! I really enjoyed wandering around the streets there.

I also went to the Jam and implemented a nice effect that someone showed during the Stammtisch (slit-scan).
